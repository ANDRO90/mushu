* Write data to file
* Port to Python 3
* Think about how to receive triggers
    * maybe as decorators (not Python-decorators):

        >>> amp = SomeAmp()
        >>> amp = TcpTriggerDecorator(amp)

* add get_channels to GTecAmp
* add get_channels to Epoc
* add configure_with_gui to GTecAmp
* add configure_with_gui to Epoc
* maybe add a classmethod to the amp base class .from_config(cls, configstr)
  which returns an amplifier which is already configured
