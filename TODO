* Now that the data_fetcher is a process, it shares the same amp as the other
  process, how do we fix that?
* maybe add a staticmethod to the amp base class to test if this amp is
  connected to the computer and thus available
* maybe add a classmethod to the amp base class .from_config(cls, configstr)
  which returns an amplifier which is already configured
